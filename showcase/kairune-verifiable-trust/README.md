# Kairune — Verifiable Agent Trust Layer

The trust layer for AI agents that spend. Kairune computes a deterministic trust
score (0–1000) from an agent's behavior history and grants or revokes spending
permission by tier.

**Showcased upgrade — verifiable attestations:** issuers register Ed25519 keys
and sign each attestation; the server verifies every signature; the scoring
engine weights verified attestations fully and discounts unsigned ones (0.25×).
Backward compatible — existing unsigned submissions still work, recorded as
`unverified`.

**Since first submission — proven wallets and self-serve spend:**

- **Wallet proof (EIP-191).** An agent proves it controls the wallet it claims
  by signing a server-issued challenge with `personal_sign` (chain `4663`,
  domain-bound, 600s TTL). The private key never leaves the wallet, and proof
  status is a public read — a payer deciding whether to release funds needs to
  know whether the address it is about to pay was ever proven. Scope is
  deliberately narrow: this proves wallet control, not trustworthiness.
- **Self-serve permissions.** Granting a budget, spending, scoping payees,
  setting expiry and revoking no longer need a platform admin key. The trust
  tier is the access control: below EMERGING (score 250) a grant is refused
  with `409 tier_too_low`. An agent earns its budget rather than being handed
  one, and the API is usable by agents that are not us.
- **A film of the refusal.** The 0:13 demo walks the whole arc, including the
  part most demos leave out: the agent asks for a budget while UNRATED and is
  turned down. It earns attestations, crosses 250, asks again, and gets a
  ceiling it cannot exceed. No admin key appears anywhere in that path.
